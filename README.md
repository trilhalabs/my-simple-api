# ðŸš€ My Simple Api

Simple API to demonstrate basics Docker and AWS ECS functions.

Based on [wisdom image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pauloclouddev/wisdom-img)

## ðŸŽ¯ What Does it Do?

This container starts a webserver on port 80, and it has three endpoints:

- `/` route that shows a simple `It Works.`
- `/greeting` route that shows a simple `Hello friend!`
- `/wisdom` route that shows a random quote (feed from a list of quotes).

***

## ðŸ›  Usage

To start this container, map local port 80 into the container.

âš™ Command

```shell
# build the image
sudo docker build -t <your-dockerhub-name>/<your-docker-repo-name> .

# test the container locally
sudo docker run <your-dockerhub-name>/<your-docker-repo-name>
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-simple-api <your-dockerhub-name>/my-simple-api

# push it to your Docker repository
sudo docker push <your-dockerhub-name>/<your-docker-repo-name> 
```
***

### ðŸ“Œ Testing locally

- Depends on run the image

```shell

http://localhost
http://localhost/greeting
http://localhost/wisdom

#stopping the container
docker stop my-simple-api

```
